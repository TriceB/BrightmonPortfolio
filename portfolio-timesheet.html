            <p>For GME Harmonization - Transfer to Rotator Package (Baker Hughes)
                <br><br>
                This project started out as a solution for 1 employee with a unique work situation that preveneted him from using the time tracking system. A Manual/Hybrid Solution was required in order to ensure the employee could track his work activity and receive accurate payment.
                <br><br>
                I prepared an automated excel timesheet, user friendly and easy to track the work activity and variable payments for a Rotator requiring a hybrid solution.

                <br><br>
                After creating 10+ functions based on company policy and individual employee contract, the employee is able to immediately see payments for work activities, early and extended bonus, yearly bonus, daily, weekly and monthly hitch count, each time a selection is made.

                <br><br>
                Tailored training sessions were held to assist the employee in understanding how to use the manual timesheet.
                <br><br>
                This solution was later expanded and used for 20 other Rotators under different contracts and work situations. In 2021 it was also used during "eFACTS to Kronos Migration for Global Rotators" to assist developers  in understanding the system requirements. In 2021-2022 it was also used to assist with paying employees during the National Kronos Outage.
